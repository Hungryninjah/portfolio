# judemlim.github.io
My react website portfolio

The master branch contains the production build of the website, while the website-src branch contains all the source code relating to the website.
It is made this way so that the profile link "judemlim.github.io" will show the website homepage.

This master branch is updated using the npm command "npm run deploy" with the website-src branch
